## Introduction

Over the years, my dad, Ken Ayling, would tell us about his boyhood memories and experiences at the family cottage on Devil Lake, as well as those at his home in Kingston. A year or so after I retired in 2014 and moved to my own place on Devil Lake, I decided that I should try to write these stories down somehow. I was not sure of all the details but was able to have him retell some of the stories before he sadly passed away in October 2016. Thus started my attempt to document the "Aylings of Devil Lake" story.

In the process of putting Ken's recollections into a story, I realized that while it was my grandfather George Ayling who bought the first property on Devil Lake, it was really my great-grandfather, Henry Ayling, and his love of fishing who may have started it all. It was his children who took that and made Devil Lake and the shores of Green's Bay their "Golden Pond". That realization, and the lack of stories Ken had about his grandparents' origins, made me want to know more about Henry, and his wife Ellen, their roots, and lives in England and Canada. This led to my foray into the world of genealogy and family trees.

As a result, the "Aylings of Devil Lake" story has expanded to include quite a bit about Henry and Ellen's life story, before Devil Lake came into the picture. The following is what I have been able to put together so far. It is a work in progress, but I hope that you find it interesting.

### Notes

1. Most of the anecdotal information that I have is from Ken's memories and experiences as a young boy, and my memory of his telling them to us. According to Ken, Henry and Eliza, and their children, rarely, if ever, talked about their life in England, at least not while he was around. It is my hope that reading this story will trigger your recollections of "Henry & Ellen Ayling" stories told to you by your parents, as well as those of your own experiences growing up on Devil Lake. I would appreciate you sending any of those to me, so that I can add them to what I have done.
2. I found a website, [Ayling History.net](http://aylinghistory.net), that has a lot of historical information on the Ayling families in Sussex County, England. The moderator, Chris Ayling from Toronto, was very helpful in providing information related to Henry's ancestors.
3. Eventually, I am going to try to get into the Devil Lake stories of the descendants of Henry and Eliza, up to present day. Again, I would appreciate you sending any of those to me as well. No promises though as to when or how far I will get in putting them into the "Aylings of Devil Lake" story.

## Henry & Ellen Ayling

In researching the ancestors and descendants of Henry Ayling and his wife Ellen Eliza Ayres, I have initially focused mainly on the paternal Ayling line. In addition to Family Trees, showing family members and relationships, I have provided additional details that I discovered regarding their births, deaths, marriages, occupations, residences, and a few other bits of information.

### Henry's Ancestry

Henry Ayling was born on Dec. 13, 1875, in Chelsea, Middlesex County, England. He was the youngest* of seven children born to Robert and Emily (nee Thompson) Ayling. (*Assumed as I found no other records for any more children born to Robert and Emily after Henry).

#### Parents
- **Robert Ayling**
  - Born: 1832, Cuckfield, Sussex
  - Died: 1877, Islington, London* (*No other info found yet to verify this was Henry's father. However, the 1881 census lists Emily as a widow)
- **Emily Thompson**
  - Born: 1834, Ringmer, Sussex
  - Died: Unknown

#### Siblings
- Frederick William, B. 1853, Brighton, Sussex
- George, B. 1857, Brighton, Sussex
- Emily, B. 1860, Brighton, Sussex
- Albert Arthur, B. 1865, Brighton, Sussex
- Alice, B. 1867, Maidstone, Kent
- Rose (or Rosa), B. 1870, Shoreditch, London

Robert Ayling and Emily Thompson were married in 1852 in Southwick, Sussex. According to Henry's birth certificate, Robert and Emily were living at 7 Leader Street (now named Ixworth Place), Chelsea, London, England when Henry was born. Robert's occupation is listed as Confectioner. In tracing Henry's ancestors, I found that a number of them listed confectioner as their occupation on the Census reports. Unsure whether this means that they were candy makers, sold candy, or both. Although Henry did not follow in his father's footsteps, he must have learned the trade. My dad, Ken, mentioned to me a number of times that he remembered Henry making different types of fancy candy at home in Kingston.

#### Paternal Grandparents
- **George Ayling**
  - Born: 1802, Arundel, Sussex
- **Mary Clark**
  - Born: 1801, Cuckfield, Sussex

Robert was born to George Ayling and Mary Clark. His siblings were George W. (1829–1906) and Eliza Anna (1834–?). In the 1851 UK Census, the family was living at 6 Mount St., Brighton, Sussex. George Sr.'s occupation is listed as a Fly proprietor, George Jr. as a Fly driver, and Eliza's as a Dress and Cloak maker. (*A Fly is a small horse-drawn carriage used as a taxi.)

#### Paternal Great-Grandparents
- **Abraham Ayling**
  - Born: 1779, Arundel, Sussex
  - Died: 1804
- **Margaret (Sotcher?)**
  - Born: pre-1785, Arundel, Sussex
  - Died: ?

George was born to Abraham Ayling and Margaret. While the birth records for George and his siblings list Abraham as their father, their mother's name is listed only as Margaret or Margaretta. There are a number of marriage records showing Abraham Ayling marrying a Margaret or Margaretta, having a son named George Ayling, but Margaret Sotcher seems the most plausible. It shows Abraham and Margaret getting married on Aug. 5, 1793.

#### Other Paternal Ancestors
After Abraham and Margaret, the available online records become very difficult for tracing the family line to any great level of certainty. Chris Ayling provided a possible "pedigree" for Henry's ancestors, based on his research that goes back another five generations from Abraham. However, I have no idea of its accuracy.
- Anthony Ayling, B: 1731, Pulborough, Sussex, married to Mary Clayter
- Anthony Ayling, B: 1701, Pulborough, Sussex, married to Jane Charman
- Anthony Ayling, B: 1678, Pulborough, Sussex, married to Jane Garrett
- Anthony Ayling, B: 1640, Pulborough, Sussex, married to Joanna Balcombe
- Anthony Ayling, B: about 1575, Selham, Sussex, married to Alice Knowles

#### Summary
To this point, I have been able to trace Henry's ancestors back three generations, to Arundel, Sussex County with a high degree of confidence. Using Chris Ayling's research, they can be possibly traced back another five generations to Selham, Sussex. Eventually, they arrived in Chelsea, London, Middlesex County where he was born. On the way, they lived in Pulborough, Cuckfield, Brighton, Southwick, Maidstone, Shoreditch, and Islington.

#### Parents
- **Frederick C. Ayres**
  - Born: 1836, Islington, Middlesex
- **Alice E. Newman**
  - Born: 1835, St. Pancras, Middlesex

#### Siblings
- Frederick C., B: 1855, Islington
- Arthur T., B: 1860, Birmingham
- Edwin J.H., B: 1862, Islington

School to Yerbery Rd. School, then back to Cottenham Rd. School. However, did find Workhouse Records from 1886 listing a Henry Ayling being admitted, then discharged several times under court orders. He was accused of stealing pastries from a Workhouse Master, along with three other boys.)
- **1891 Census**: Henry (age 15) was living with his mother at 72 Mitford Rd., Islington. Emily's occupation was listed as a self-employed dressmaker, Henry's listed as a warehouseman. (Note: This is the last address that I have been able to find for Emily.) Ellen was living with her parents at 83 Cottenham Road.

His father Robert is shown as deceased but his mother Emily was still alive. Henry's sister, Alice Cross (married to George Cross), is listed as a witness. Henry's occupation was listed as a bricklayer, and that he was living at 52 Cottenham Road, Islington. (Note that Henry and his mother lived at 53 Cottenham Road in the 1881 census, and were still there in 1888.)

This was during the Victorian era, a very harsh period for the poor, which Charles Dickens vividly described in his novels. Emily had three young children under the age of ten and had raised Henry until he was at least 13 yrs. old.
- **May 20, 1906**: Family arrives at Quebec City, Canada. A National Archive record of the Kensington's Passenger List has Henry listed as Harvey.

The house is no longer there, but was near the present-day location of the Royal Canadian Legion, Branch #9 building. According to Ken Ayling, Henry became well known for raising chickens. He recalls a local barber, Earl Blaney, telling him that Henry was the first to bring Rhode Island Red chickens to the Kingston area. Henry's occupation shown as bricklayer, Ernest as hydro lineman, Fred as a labourer at Frontenac Tile.
- **George, Nora, and Kenneth**: Living at 769 Montreal Street. George's occupation shown as baker.

## The Devil Lake Era

In 1938, Henry, Ellen, and Florrie moved in with their son George's family on Hickson Ave. Sometime before this, Henry and George had started to spend time fishing, probably because where they had been living in the CNR Outer Station area on Montreal St. was very close to the Cataraqui River. Ken, who would have been around 10 yr. old, recalled that Henry had a small fishing boat which he kept on the river near the old Pump House at the bottom of Elliot Avenue (now the west end of the new Wabban bridge), about a mile from their house. As George worked during the week, Henry often took Ken to keep him company while fishing, and to row the boat. They would walk from their home to the boat and spend the day fishing. George would join them on the weekends and holidays. Ken remembered Henry sitting at the back of the boat, smoking his pipe while Ken rowed. As he fished, Henry would talk to the "little fishies", telling them about the delicious bait he was using, in his very strong Chelsea accent.

Throughout the summer, George would take his family for day trips and picnics to the many lakes and rivers in the immediate area around Kingston, Ontario. Henry and Ellen (until she passed away) would often go along as well. And of course, there would always be a little fishing. Towards the end of the 1930s, the federal and provincial governments had created a few more "statutory" holidays. During some of these long weekends, George would rent a cottage somewhere. The Huffman cottages on Fourteen Island Lake (pickerel fishing) was a popular place for them to stay. In 1941, they ended up renting a cottage on Devil Lake from Bill Lee. I believe that the cottage was somewhere near the present-day boat ramp off the Perth Road. It may have been here that they discovered lake trout, and the beauty of Devil Lake. However, the next time he tried to rent the cottage, it was not available. Bill Lee told him that Sam Whalley, who had a farm just up the road to the south, had a small cottage that he sometimes rented out if it was not being used by his family. George went to Sam and was able to rent it.

After a number of trips to the lake, George decided that he wanted to have their own cottage on Devil Lake. In the summer of 1943, they approached Sam Whalley about buying a piece of waterfront property from him, on the northeast corner of Sam's farm, next to what is now the beach area of Pine Haven Campground. Young Ken was with them, and although he can't recall why, Sam told them that he had another piece of property that he thought they would like even more. They walked across the field, where the campground is located these days, out onto Russell's Point, and over to the Davis' cottage, which is now owned by Peter Woods, Victor Davis' grandson. He pointed to a piece of property on the far side of a small cove just to the south of Davis'. Of course, it looked a lot different back then, as there were very few trees growing because of the cattle Sam had grazing in the area. It must have caught their eyes though, as they ended up walking over to the property for a closer look. Old Sam paced off an area one hundred feet from the shore and asked $200 for it. George agreed. Sam also made a deal to sell 6 pine logs to them to use for making the foundation, in exchange for 6 of Henry's Rhode Island Reds.

All that winter, George and Henry worked at building "pre-fab" sections of walls and trusses at George's place on Hickson Ave. Of course, these were the war years and lumber of any kind was scarce. George worked at Frontenac Tile (the Tile Works) in Kingston and was able to get some of the lumber from shipping crates to use in building these pre-fab sections. They hired a local trucking firm (Cote Bros.) to bring the sections out to Devil Lake in the spring of 1944. They would only take them to the top of the hill, as they were afraid they might not get back out, as there was still snow and ice.

Sadly, Henry never got to see the cottage, as he passed away in April of 1944.

- **June 3, 1944**: George officially purchases his first cottage lot on Devil Lake for $200 from Sam Whaley. Lot was located on the NE point of Green's Bay, on the Whaley farm. Over that summer they cleared land and built a 20' x 20' cottage using the prefab sections Henry and George had made, and the pine logs from Sam Whaley. (Note: During renovations in 2019, all but one of those logs were still in good condition and are still there.)
- **Nov. 17, 1945**: George purchased an adjacent lot to the south for $200. According to Ken, George used the money from the sale of a new car he had won in a raffle held by a charity in Hamilton. He had bought the ticket from his sister Winnie, who was living in Hamilton, and was present when George's winning ticket was drawn. It was George's intention to keep buying more land whenever he had the money to do so. Unfortunately, his wife Nora had a falling out with Tish Whalley, who said that they would not sell any more property to the Aylings.
- **May 1944**: Eddie passed away. He was buried in Cataraqui Cemetery, Kingston.
- **Oct. 8, 1947**: Jack and Nina Young, sister and brother-in-law of George's wife Nora, purchase the Whalley farm, eventually starting up Pine Haven campground.
- **Aug. 23, 1956**: Frank and Win Koen purchased a lot on the NW point of Green's Bay for $300 from the Young's.
- **Aug. 20, 1958**: Bob and Edie Campbell purchased an adjacent lot west of the Koen's for $500 from the Young's.
- **July 9, 1963**: Wally and Agnes Ayling purchase lot on the west shore side of Green's Bay from the Young's for $400.
- **Aug. 6, 1964**: Alf and Maudie Ayling purchase lot on the west shore side of Green's Bay, adjacent to Wally & Agnes, from the Young's for $400.
- **May 11, 1965**: Al and Doris Ward purchase the Whalley farm from the Young's for $5500. The Ward's were not related to any of the Ayling family.
- **Jul. 21, 1978**: Alice passed away. She was buried in Cataraqui Cemetery, Kingston.
- **Nov. 28, 1982**: George passed away. He was buried in Cataraqui Cemetery, Kingston.
- **Jan. 22, 1984**: Fred passed away. He was buried in United Church Cemetery, Westport.
- **June 18, 1987**: Alf passed away. He was buried in Glenhaven Cemetery, Glenburnie, Ont.
- **Nov. 25, 1991**: Emma passed away.
- **Mar. 6, 1995**: Wally passed away. He was buried in Glenhaven Cemetery, Glenburnie.
- **Dec. 1, 2006**: Winnie passed away. Her ashes are interred in a crypt at their family cottage on Devil Lake.
- **Jul. 1, 2019**: Florrie passed away. She was buried in Glenhaven Cemetery.

## Appendix

### I. Abraham Ayling and Margaret Sotcher Marriage Certificate
Abraham Ayling married Margaret Sotcher in Arundel in August 1793. Their first two children were baptized in Binsted:
- 27/04/1794 Abraham Abraham Margaret AYLING
- 04/06/1797 William Abraham Margaret AYLING

*Note that "Abecham" seems to have signed his own name, something we do not always see in marriage records before the 1800s, and implying a higher level of literacy.*
